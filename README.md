# Py Game

## Introduction
This is a python generated game (so-called py_game), and I re-name it as **Kitchen Contest**. The game is used to test out one's foods recognition and preparing techniques. 

The game consists of four stages:
1. Warm-up
2. Multiple choices with images
3. Multiple choice with words
4. IQ Questions

## How to play the Py Game
To run this game, you should:

2. Upload **.ipynb** file and **images** folder to local Jupyter Notebook repository.
3. Click on **.ipynb** file to run source code.
